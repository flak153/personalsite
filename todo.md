# Project Ideas Todo

- [ ] **Interactive Algorithm Visualizer:**
    - **Concept:** Create a tool that visually demonstrates how common algorithms work (e.g., sorting algorithms like quicksort or merge sort, pathfinding algorithms like A* or Dijkstra's, or data structure operations like tree traversals).
    - **Tech:** Canvas API, P5.js, or Konva.js.

- [ ] **WebAssembly (Wasm) Playground/Demo:**
    - **Concept:** Develop a small utility or demo that uses WebAssembly. This could be anything from a simple image processing tool, a physics simulation, or a small module written in Rust/C++/Go compiled to Wasm.
    - **Tech:** Rust/C++/Go, Wasm toolchains (e.g., `wasm-pack` for Rust), JavaScript/TypeScript for integration.

- [ ] **Generative Art Creator:**
    - **Concept:** Build a tool that allows users to create or explore generative art. This could involve parameters users can tweak to produce different visual outputs (e.g., Perlin noise fields, particle systems, geometric patterns).
    - **Tech:** Canvas API, WebGL, or P5.js.

- [ ] **Decentralized Identity (DID) or Verifiable Credential (VC) Explorer:** (Status: In Progress)
    - **Concept:** Create a tool that helps users understand or experiment with basic concepts of DIDs or VCs. This could be a simple DID generator/resolver or a tool to create and verify a basic VC.
    - **Tech:** JavaScript libraries for DIDs/VCs (e.g., `did-jwt`, `ceramic-sdk`).

- [ ] **Mini Network Protocol Simulator:**
    - **Concept:** A visual tool that simulates basic network interactions, like the TCP handshake, DNS resolution, or HTTP request/response flow.
    - **Tech:** Canvas for visualization, TypeScript for logic.
