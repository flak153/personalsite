# Decentralized Identity (DID) & Verifiable Credential (VC) Explorer

An interactive playground for exploring how digital identity can work without central authorities, using cryptography to ensure trust.

## Real-World Scenario: How DIDs & VCs Work

Imagine Sarah is graduating from university and needs to prove her degree to employers:

### üéì The Traditional Way (Problems)
1. Sarah gets a paper diploma (can be forged)
2. Employers must call the university to verify (time-consuming)
3. University database could be hacked or go offline
4. Sarah has no control over her own credentials

### üîê The DID & VC Way (Solutions)
1. **Sarah creates her DID** - Her own cryptographic identity that she controls
2. **University issues a VC** - They digitally sign her degree with their DID
3. **Instant verification** - Employers verify the signature mathematically
4. **Tamper-proof** - Any changes invalidate the signature
5. **Always available** - No need to contact the university

### üöÄ Try This Scenario Yourself

Let's simulate Sarah getting her university degree credential:

1. **Sarah (You):** Generate your personal DID and **copy it** - you'll need to share it with the university
2. **University:** Generate an institution DID to represent the university
3. **Issue Degree:** **Manually paste** Sarah's DID and issue her a credential, then **copy the credential**
4. **Employer:** **Paste the credential** you received to verify its authenticity

The manual copy-paste simulates real-world communication where different parties don't share the same system!

## Try It Yourself

The explorer above lets you play all three roles in the credential ecosystem:

1. **As an Individual** - Generate your personal DID (your digital identity)
2. **As an Institution** - Issue a credential to someone by entering their DID
3. **As a Verifier** - Verify the credential's authenticity through cryptography

Watch the animations to see:
- How institutions cryptographically sign credentials
- The step-by-step verification process
- Why tampering is impossible without the private key

## Why This Matters

- **You own your identity** - No company or government controls your DID
- **Instant verification** - No phone calls, no waiting
- **Cannot be forged** - Cryptography makes fakes impossible
- **Privacy-preserving** - Share only what's needed
- **Works offline** - No central server required

{/* Technical implementation details for developers */}
{/* 
## Technical Stack
- Ed25519 cryptography for signatures
- W3C DID and VC specifications
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Security Considerations for Production
- Store private keys in hardware security modules
- Implement proper key rotation policies
- Follow W3C credential schemas
- Add revocation mechanisms
- Consider privacy-preserving features like selective disclosure

## Roadmap Ideas
- Multiple DID methods (did:web, did:ion)
- Verifiable Presentations
- Blockchain integration
- Zero-knowledge proofs
