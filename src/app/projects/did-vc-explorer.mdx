# Decentralized Identity (DID) & Verifiable Credential (VC) Explorer

An interactive playground for exploring how digital identity can work without central authorities, using cryptography to ensure trust.

<DidVcExplorer />

## Real-World Scenario: How DIDs & VCs Work

Imagine Sarah is graduating from university and needs to prove her degree to employers:

### üéì The Traditional Way (Problems)
1. Sarah gets a paper diploma (can be forged)
2. Employers must call the university to verify (time-consuming)
3. University database could be hacked or go offline
4. Sarah has no control over her own credentials

### üîê The DID & VC Way (Solutions)
1. **Sarah creates her DID** - Her own cryptographic identity that she controls
2. **University issues a VC** - They digitally sign her degree with their DID
3. **Instant verification** - Employers verify the signature mathematically
4. **Tamper-proof** - Any changes invalidate the signature
5. **Always available** - No need to contact the university

## Try It Yourself

The explorer above lets you experience this process:
1. **Generate a DID** - Create your cryptographic identity
2. **Issue a credential** - Sign it with your DID (in real life, institutions would do this)
3. **Verify it** - See how the math proves authenticity

## Why This Matters

- **You own your identity** - No company or government controls your DID
- **Instant verification** - No phone calls, no waiting
- **Cannot be forged** - Cryptography makes fakes impossible
- **Privacy-preserving** - Share only what's needed
- **Works offline** - No central server required

{/* Technical implementation details for developers */}
{/* 
## Technical Stack
- Ed25519 cryptography for signatures
- W3C DID and VC specifications
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Security Considerations for Production
- Store private keys in hardware security modules
- Implement proper key rotation policies
- Follow W3C credential schemas
- Add revocation mechanisms
- Consider privacy-preserving features like selective disclosure

## Roadmap Ideas
- Multiple DID methods (did:web, did:ion)
- Verifiable Presentations
- Blockchain integration
- Zero-knowledge proofs
