# AI Asteroids: Self-Learning Game

Watch as a neural network learns to play the classic Asteroids game in real-time using TensorFlow.js.

<AsteroidsGame />

## How It Works

This implementation uses a neural network that learns through reinforcement learning:

1. **Neural Network Architecture**: The AI uses a simple feedforward neural network with:
   - Input layer: Game state (ship position, asteroid positions, velocities)
   - Hidden layers: Two dense layers with ReLU activation
   - Output layer: Actions (thrust, rotate left, rotate right, shoot)

2. **Reinforcement Learning**: The AI learns by:
   - Receiving rewards for destroying asteroids and surviving
   - Receiving penalties for collisions
   - Using experience replay to improve over time

3. **Training Process**: 
   - The network starts with random actions
   - Gradually learns patterns and strategies
   - Improves performance through multiple generations

## Features

- **Real-time Learning**: Watch the AI improve as it plays
- **Manual Control**: Switch between AI and manual control
- **Training Visualization**: See the neural network's decision-making process
- **Performance Metrics**: Track score, survival time, and learning progress

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow.js**: For neural network implementation
- **React**: For UI and game state management
- **Canvas API**: For rendering the game
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development
