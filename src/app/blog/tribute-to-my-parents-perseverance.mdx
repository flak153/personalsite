This is the story of my parents, a story of incredible resilience, unwavering determination, and the pursuit of a dream against all odds. It’s a story that shaped who I am and one that I carry with me every day.

My parents grew up in neighboring villages in Bangladesh, a land of lush green rice paddies and tight-knit communities. My father was born into a very poor rice farming family. Their lives, and his earliest memories, were irrevocably scarred by the Bangladesh War of Independence in 1971. One of his first recollections is of hiding in a rice field with his grandfather while invading Pakistani soldiers ransacked their village and burned his home to the ground. At the tender age of seven, he was left with nothing but the clothes on his back. For years following this devastation, eleven members of his family shared a single, small tin shack.

Despite these hardships, my father was a prodigious student, particularly gifted in mathematics. As an elementary school kid, he often found himself tutoring boys much older than him, using the meager earnings to help support his family. To pay for his own school tuition, he would climb towering coconut and jackfruit trees to harvest and sell their fruit. He was a well-rounded individual, founding his local village's theatre group and excelling as a star athlete – a volleyball player with an astonishing 22-foot long jump. His thirst for knowledge was insatiable; he even taught himself differential equations from an English language textbook, a language he didn't yet speak. His perseverance paid off: he became the first person in his village of nearly 100,000 people to earn a Master's degree, in Mathematics. To this day, three decades after he emigrated, he remains a minor celebrity when he returns home. Everyone for miles around his ancestral village, from ages 30 to 60, knows his name and his story.

My mother was a bright college student when fate intervened – she won the Green Card lottery. In their respective circles, my parents were considered the most eligible bachelor and bachelorette. It wasn't long before their paths crossed, and they were married.

Their new life together soon took an unexpected turn when my mother became pregnant with me. A new urgency arose. My parents had their US immigration paperwork in order, but a child born in Bangladesh would not automatically share that status. The prospect of navigating a complex, lengthy, and uncertain immigration process for a newborn, while they themselves were just establishing their lives, was a daunting one. My family couldn't afford these potential entanglements and the simplest way was ensuring I was born on American soil. This meant he had to scramble to put together the money for plane tickets to the USA. As a school teacher in those days, he earned a modest $8 a month. One-way flights for him and my mother would cost around $2000 each – an astronomical sum. The stories of how he managed to gather those funds are legendary in our family, a testament to his resourcefulness and sheer will.

Just two weeks before I was born, on April 14, 1996, my parents landed in America. They arrived in a new country where they didn't speak the language, encountering everyday marvels like refrigerators and modern stoves for the first time. And they had a newborn son on the way. After all was said and done, when they touched down in the USA, my father had only $20 left to his name.

They were homeless. Imagine my mother: 23 years old, in a foreign land with no grasp of the language, a newborn baby in her arms, and no place to call home. But my father’s resilience shone through. He quickly found a job as a hotdog vendor on the streets of New York. A kind family, fellow immigrants themselves, offered them a place to sleep on their living room floor.

From those incredibly humble beginnings, sleeping on a floor in the Bronx, my parents built a life. They faced down unimaginable challenges with courage, dignity, and an unshakeable belief in a better future for their children. Their journey is a profound reminder of the sacrifices immigrants make, the strength of the human spirit, and the enduring power of hope.

Their perseverance is the foundation upon which my life is built, and their story is the legacy I strive to honor in everything I do.
