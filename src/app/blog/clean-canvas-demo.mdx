# Canvas Demo

This is a test of the interactive Canvas component with a built-in animation.

## Bouncing Ball Demo

The following Canvas element shows a simple bouncing ball animation:

<Canvas id="bouncingBall" height="200px" />

This animation is implemented directly in the Canvas component, so it doesn't rely on external script tags.

## Physics Demo

This Canvas shows a more complex physics simulation with boxes that respond to gravity:

<Canvas id="physicsDemo" height="300px" />

You can click on the canvas to add more boxes!

## How It Works

The Canvas component uses React's `useEffect` hook to set up the animation:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const canvas = document.getElementById(id);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  
  function draw() {
    // Drawing code here
    requestAnimationFrame(draw);
  }
  
  draw();
}, [id]);
```

This approach makes the interactive demos more reliable in a React environment.
